Early administrators of independent India, while classifying the country into different states based on linguistic pattern, thought of grouping the states into five zones. The idea was first suggested by Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru in 1956 during the debate on the report of [States Reorganisation Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_Reorganisation_Commission). The idea was to create four or five advisory councils based on region and corresponding states will be their members. The main aim behind constituting such councils was to prevent the isolation of states, which were formed on basis of linguistic pattern of the people living there and to promote a healthy inter-state and center state environment to solve inter-state problems.

With this vision of Pt. Nehru, five zonal councils, namely Northern, Southern, Western, Eastern and Central zonal councils, were setup by Part-III of the [States Re-organisation Act, 1956](http://legislative.gov.in/sites/default/files/A1956-37.pdf).North eastern council was setup under [North Eastern Council act, 1971](https://indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/1580/2/A1971-84.pdf) as a statutory body to look after the problems of the north eastern states which were not a part of any of the zonal councils.
