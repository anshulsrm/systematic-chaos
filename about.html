  <h1>About Systematic Chaos</h1>
  <p>
    There are more than 7 Billion people all around the world, and every second 3 more are added you check here <a href="http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/">World population metre</a>. From the very first civilization to the modern day global community there is one thing which humans invented even prior to wheels which is ADMINISTRATION. Ranging from a country comprising of population more than a billion to a village or tribes having few hundreds there is one thing which we always find in different forms, types and the way it is implemented and that is administration of people in a community.

  <p>
    This blog isn't a guide or research on administrations, it is just just a collection of examples of different and forms and types of administration followed allover the world, with information being collected from various general sources such as Internet mostly, books, newspapers, etc. I don't criticize or appreciate any form of administration, I just explain them to you as they are, because I believe every city, area or a locality has its own type of ecosystem, which might or might not be recognized by the government of that area but it does exists and people follow them and we should know about it.
